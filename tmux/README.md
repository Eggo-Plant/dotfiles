# Tmux Dotfiles
**This is the config that I use on all setups**

**List of Changes:**
* Change the Ctrl+b prefix to Ctrl+a because it's easier to type in
* Split panes with | and - instead of " and % because that just makes sense
* Enable mouse interaction with tmux
* Move around panes with Alt + Direction
* Resize windows with Prefix + Alt + Direction
* Hit Prefix + r to reload the config from ~/.tmux.conf
