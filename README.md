# Eggo-Plant's dotfiles

> Or in layman's terms; "config files"

All my config files that I spend a relatively signficiant amount of time working on, I upload here. Mostly just for convenience so I can easily grab them to use on any other computer, or you could use them for reference for your dotfiles. I try to keep them well commented so that it's easy to understand what things do.
