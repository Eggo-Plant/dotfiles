**My dotfiles for nvim**
>this might work with vim but I haven't tried it.
It can be a drag and drop replacement for any nvim config. The config will auto-install the correct plugin manager (vim-plug), and install any required plugins on first boot.

**List of Installed Plugins:**
* **YouCompleteMe** - Code completion
* **NERDTree** - Sidebar to manage multiple files in a folder
* **Vim-DevIcons** - Plugin for NERDTree to display icons that correspond to folder/filetypes
* **Vim-NERDTree-Syntax-Highlight** - Adds syntax highlighting to NERDTree
* **Limelight** - It's sort of hard to explain what this does. It's best explained on the [repo](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim)
* **Vim-Airline** - Makes a "fancier" statusbar at the bottom
* **Vim-Commentary** - Adds some keybinds to quickly comment-out lines
* **Vim-CSS-Color** - Adds color highlighting in CSS files for color codes/names
* **Vim-Paste-Easy** - Unbreaks weird indent issues when pasting multiple lines
* **Vim-Lastplace** - Centers the cursor on previous position when re-opening a file
